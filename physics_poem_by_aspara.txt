The universe, a symphony of laws,
Where gravity's embrace, a constant cause.
From atoms dancing, to stars ablaze,
Physics unfolds, in wondrous ways.

The light that shines, a wave and particle,
A duality, a cosmic article.
Electromagnetism, a force so grand,
Guiding currents, across the land.

Quantum realm, where strangeness reigns,
Superposition, defying all chains.
Uncertainty, a principle so deep,
The secrets of the universe, we seek to keep.

From Newton's laws, to Einstein's might,
Physics unravels, day and night.
A journey of discovery, a quest for truth,
Unveiling the mysteries, of our cosmic youth.
